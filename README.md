# AV-lighting-conversion-program
This program takes spreadsheet cue data and translates it for use in our lighting control system.

This code is intended for UTS SHOW A/V members to increase lighting programming productivity by allowing multiple students to work at the same time

1. fixed.py is intended to account for an intrinsic delay our our lighting board has, translate.py is meant to process lighting cue data from a CSV file, performs RGB to RGBIL color transformations, and outputs the formatted data, and converter.py is meant to combine both programs into one
2. The resulting work must be exported to a USB flash drive and physically plugged into the lighting board, which we received for SHOW '23
3. I am not the creator of this program, although it has been optimized by multiple team members a majority of it was written by Kenny Huang (UTS '24) who is currently studying at Waterloo University. I am merely reproducing the program in a more accessible way in formal location.
4. To be continued...
